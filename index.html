        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm an aspiring Web Designer who has 5 years experience in IT. I was formally a Service Deliver Manager and then a Sales Rep for various large IT companies in Sydney, Australia. I really believe in the power of the internet and Web Dev as there are so many opportunities. My focus for Web Dev is to become a good Web Designer and utilising my Sales and Management experience to help my clients get more sales through digital marketing.</p>
        <p>Prior to working in the IT sector I was formally a Business English teacher and business Partner at Lingu which is a very successful language service provider in Norway. I was also a Hydrographic Surveyor in the Australian Navy </p>
